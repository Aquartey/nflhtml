      While the NFL trade deadline doesn't get the hype of its MLB, NBA or even
      NHL counterparts, it has become a bigger deal on the league calendar in
      recent years. And trade rumors are flying as the Nov. 1 deadline
      approaches. We've already seen some deals happen, with the Carolina
      Panthers trading running back Christian McCaffrey to the San Francisco
      49ers days after sending receiver Robbie Anderson to the Arizona
      Cardinals. The New York Jets made noise Monday, dealing for Jacksonville
      Jaguars running back James Robinson. So with a week left, we asked our
      trusted NFL Nation reporters to identify one player on the team they cover
      who could be pursued or dealt before the deadline.There are players who
      have been first-round draft picks and Pro Bowlers and a former rushing
      champion on this list, along with a guy who had 18.5 sacks last year.
      We've graded the handful of trades that already have been completed, and
      ESPN reporter Jeremy Fowler last week went through the early buzz on
      players who were brought up in discussions.

      The legend of Cowboys' Emmitt Smith's NFL rushing record and why it might
      never be broken.
    </h1>

    <p style="color: grey">
      Fittingly, it's on the outside of his right leg, which helped him become
      the NFL's all-time leading rusher with 18,355 yards. "Warren Sapp started
      calling me 'Zip Code,'" Smith said. "I'm the only one in that zip code ...
      Population of one." On Oct. 27, 2002, with an 11-yard carry in the fourth
      quarter against the Seattle Seahawks, Smith passed his idol, former
      Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton, on the all-time rushing list.
      Twenty years later, Smith's record looks like it could be unbreakable. Jim
      Brown held the record for 21 years before Payton, who finished with 16,726
      yards, topped him. Payton held the record for 18 years. The active rushing
      leaders are Mark Ingram II (New Orleans Saints), Ezekiel Elliott (Cowboys)
      and Derrick Henry (Tennessee Titans). Ingram, 32, would be 43 years old
      and need to play all 17 games each season at his career pace to break
      Smith's record, but he's carrying a much lighter load at this stage of his
      career. Elliott, 27, would be 35 at his current pace without missing a
      game. Henry, 28, would be 37 at his current pace without missing a
      game.The Indianapolis Colts' Jonathan Taylor, 23, led the NFL with 1,811
      yards last season and has 3,366 yards in his first two-plus NFL campaigns,
      but he has missed two games this season. He would need to play until his
      mid-30s to sniff Smith's record. "Unless at some time the game starts to
      flip back to run-first, I think it's going to be hard for a back to reach
      those numbers," Elliott said. "I just feel like a lot of it is philosophy,
      and I don't know if there's enough coaches right now that have that type
      of philosophy to allow a back to be that." Cowboys Hall of Fame receiver
      Michael Irvin was more succinct. "There's no doubt in my mind that that's
      the one record that'll never be broke," Irvin said. SMITH PLAYED 13 of his
      15 seasons for the Cowboys and spent his final two with the Arizona
      Cardinals before retiring in 2005. He completed "The Triplets" with Irvin
      and quarterback Troy Aikman when Dallas took him in the first round of the
      1990 NFL draft. Smith won three Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, XXX) and was
      the NFL Most Valuable Player and Super Bowl XXVIII MVP for the 1993
      season. Smith won four rushing titles (1991-93, '95) and ran for more than
      1,000 yards a record 11 times.

      The night before his first game, he predicted all of this to his roommate,
      Irvin. "Curfew is around 11 and it's about 10, 10:30," Smith said.
      "Michael and I are in the room. He's laying on his bed. I'm laying on my
      bed and we're having a conversation. He asked me a question, 'So what is
      it that you want to achieve in this game?' I think he was being
      inquisitive, trying to figure out where my mindset was and whether or not
      I was motivated the right way." Irvin remembers being incredulous at
      Smith's answer. "When that young man came in, we won three games one year
      and one game the year before. That's it. Three when I came in [in 1988]
      and one when Troy came in [in 1989]," Irvin said. "Emmitt comes in and
      says, 'We're going to win Super Bowls and I'm going to be the all-time
      leading rusher.' "I'm like, 'Boy, shut up. What's wrong with you? We won
      four games in two years. Take your ass to sleep. This ain't Miami [Irvin's
      college] or Florida [Smith's].'" Smith had 2 yards on two carries in his
      first game, a 17-14 win against the San Diego Chargers. "But ultimately,
      he did all that," Irvin said. "We won the super bowl and he became the all
      time leading rusher".

      New England Patriots rookie QB has wild award odds swing
    </h1>

    <p style="color: grey">
      While chants of "Zappe! Zappe! Zappe!" were ringing at Gillette Stadium, a
      flurry of big bets on New England Patriots quarterback Bailey Zappe hit
      Caesars Sportsbook, causing the first-year signal-caller's Rookie of the
      Year odds to move from 50-1 to 5-1 in approximately 30 minutes during the
      first half of Monday's game against the Chicago Bears. Caesars Sportsbook
      reported taking six bets of $1,000 or more on Zappe to win Offensive
      Rookie of the Year, after he replaced starter Mac Jones late in the first
      quarter and promptly led the Patriots to back-to-back touchdown drives.
      The largest wager of the flurry of bets was $3,000 at 16-1. The six
      four-figure wagers are the most of that size on any player offered by
      Caesars in its Rookie of the Year odds. "All it took was one possession
      with him throwing a touchdown to a guy who was wide open," Adam Pullen,
      assistant director of trading at Caesars Sportsbook, said in a company
      release. "When you leave those markets open, people are going to be
      jumping on. That's how it is nowadays. You can't rest because all it takes
      is one series or one half for people to form an opinion on things. It's
      not waiting to see how he does next game. It's the thinking that the value
      is there now so you have to take it.Zappe's odds had settled at 13-2 by
      Tuesday morning at Caesars, making him the third-favorite to win the
      Associated Press's Offensive Rookie of the Year award. Seattle Seahawks
      running back Kenneth Walker III is the favorite at 2-1, followed by
      Houston Texans running back Dameon Pierce at 3-1. Zappe's odds were as
      long as 20-1 at other sportsbooks. A rookie from Western Kentucky, Zappe
      played the remainder of the game but cooled off after his hot start. He
      finished 14-of-22 for 185 yards with a touchdown and an interception in a
      33-14 loss to the Bears. Zappe was 60-1 to win the award at DraftKings
      before Monday's game and got as short at 15-2 at one point, before
      settling at 12-1. His odds were as long as 20-1 at some books Tuesday"

      How is Packers' locker room reacting to three-game losing streak?
    </h1>

    <p style="color: grey">
      GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Marcedes Lewis hasn’t been a big part of the Green Bay
      Packers’ offense this season, but if their season is to be saved -- and
      that seems like a big if -- it might be because of the veteran tight end.
      Not because of anything Lewis will do on the field -- because at 38 years
      old, he’s only a part-time player with one catch for 2 yards this season
      -- but with his locker room presence and veteran guidance. It was Lewis
      who pulled the team together after Sunday’s 23-21 loss to the Washington
      Commanders at FedEx Field, where the Packers saw their losing streak grow
      to three games.“One thing I told the guys ... in times like this,
      individually, when I’ve had, whether it’s a couple bad plays, play a
      couple games you’d rather have back, you just lean on your work,” Lewis
      said. “We go out there and we bust our butt every day. It’s about finding
      our rhythm, and all it’s going to take is one, and they come in bunches
      after that. Time to get back to work.” That message wasn’t just for the
      offense. Cornerback Jaire Alexander, the NFL’s highest-paid cornerback,
      said it came through clearly to him. A week earlier, defensive coordinator
      Joe Barry finally let him shadow a No. 1 receiver for most of a game.
      Against the New York Jets, he got the better of Garrett Wilson. Against
      the Commanders, Terry McLaurin won the individual matchup. “It's not much
      panic in my eyes or in my voice,” Alexander said. “Every dog have their
      day. I'm still the best. Hey, I already know that, so I just think you got
      to lean on your craft. In times like this, you got to lean on the hard
      work that got you here. Marcedes Lewis said that earlier, so that's
      perfect.” Still, it must manifest. s After the second of the three losses
      in this streak, quarterback Aaron Rodgers called for a simplification of
      coach Matt LaFleur’s offense. Whatever changed -- or didn’t change -- the
      end result was much the same. “We scored 14 points [on offense against
      Washington] -- seven in a two-minute [situation], seven on a short field,”
      Rodgers said. “Last week, we scored 10 points -- three in a two-minute,
      seven in a no-huddle. It hasn’t been winning football on offense.”
